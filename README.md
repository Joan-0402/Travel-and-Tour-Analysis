6. Insights
   
    - Bookings drop slightly by 16% in off-peak season but revenue drops significantly by 43%
    - Customers spend significantly less in off-peak season by likely opting for cheaper packages
    - Accra and Mole National Park are the most visited destinations showing an interest.
    - Mole National Park generates the highest revenue indicating a strong demand
    - Accra Landmarks, Larabanga and Manhyia Palace record low revenue which could be due to low pricing or limited interest
    - Ghana Adventures has a higher customer acquisition but struggles to retain them due to lack of follow up communication after first trip
    - Repeat customers spend 36% more per trip hence are more valuable financially

7. The Recommendation

   - Invest in targeted marketing and enhance top-performing tour packages like Mole National Park and Accra.
   - Launch a loyalty program and send personalized follow-up emails after first trips to improve customer retention.
   - Prioritize high-performing booking channels by offering incentives to travel agencies and encourage walk-in clients to use online booking for future trips.
   - For underperforming destinations, test discount bundles with popular tours and rebrand only if low performance is linked to poor perception.

8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization can provide valuable insights for a small travel and tour company. By leveraging tools like Excel and Power BI, Ghana Adventures can make informed decisions that drive growth, increase retention, and improve tour performance.
